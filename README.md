# FitNexusAI: AI Personal Fit Consultant

### 🎓 Project Overview
FitNexus is a "Context-Aware" Retail AI Agent designed to reduce e-commerce return rates. Unlike standard chatbots that simply search for products, FitNexus analyzes a user's **Fit Profile** (Height, Size, Shape, Challenges) and compares it against technical garment data to provide personalized sizing advice.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Context-Aware Logic:** Adjusts advice based on user preferences (e.g., "I like tight clothes" vs. "I like loose clothes").
* **Fit Challenge Detection:** Identifies specific issues (e.g., "Large Bust", "Broad Shoulders") and warns users about potential fit problems.
* **Visual Inventory:** Dynamically displays product images based on natural language queries.
* **Data Logging:** Automatically records user interactions to measure engagement and return-reduction potential.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
* **Intelligence:** OpenAI GPT-4
* **Data:** Pandas (CSV-based Mock Inventory)
* **Infrastructure:** Streamlit Cloud

### 📊 How to Test (Pilot Instructions)
1.  Launch the App.
2.  Open the **Sidebar** to set your "Fit Profile" (Size, Height, Fit Challenges).
3.  Ask a question like: *"How does the hoodie fit?"*
4.  Observe how the AI adapts its answer based on your specific stats.
